Game Of Life
=============

This code is inspired by John Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). 

The objective is to implement the interface provided in GameOfLife.java in order to respect the four rules of the game:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
